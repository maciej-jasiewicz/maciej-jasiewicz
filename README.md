## üöÄ About
Computer science has always been my greatest source of satisfaction. Back in elementary school, I began my adventure by learning my first programming language. As a self-taught enthusiast, I spent countless hours exploring various technologies, eventually solidifying my knowledge through formal education. I derive great pleasure from collaborating on challenging projects and am quick to learn new things.
